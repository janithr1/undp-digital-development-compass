# Digital Development Compass 
The Digital Development Compass (DDC) is a visualization of an exhaustive collection of a country's digital indicators, sourced from publicly available datasets that we have aggregated and made usable for the first time. The DDC was first created as a tool for UNDP's work in supporting inclusive, whole-of-society digital transformation with partners. The DDC features hundreds of existing public data sets that provide indicators that provide insights on a country's progress in digital transformation. Users can interact with the data to understand the digital state of any nation (based on publicly available data) and see comparisons and recommendations. It is the biggest compilation of global datasets on digital, aggregating and visualizing these metrics for the first time.

# Inclusive Digital Data Repository
The DDC combines public international data sets on inclusive digital transformation with local country data sets and scoring them against our Stages of Digital Readiness (from 1 to 5.99). Leveraging the [data manifest](data_manifest_instructions.md) compiles data sources and uses [Digital Assessment Data Framework Filename Matching](Open%20Digital%20Development%20Data%20Exchange.xlsx) as the main source document for matching.

# Digital Transformation Framework
This tool is based on [UNDP's Inclusive Whole-Of-Society Digital Transformation framework](https://www.undp.org/digital/transformation). UNDP advocates for inclusive, whole-of-society digital transformation. It is a coordinated approach between government, civil society and the private sector to build ownership, support human-centred design, mitigate risks, and establish accountability. The Digital Transformation Framework helps stakeholders align on the key elements of inclusive digital transformation. The framework allows these actors to identify, structure, and prioritize efforts. The Digital Transformation Framework is split into seven pillars. Each pillar is then mapped to a sub-pillar. And each sub-pillar maps to a specific stage of digital transformation. The sub-pillar consists of any number of individual indicators. These indicators are used to calculate a country's Digital Transformation Score per sub-pillar. These scores are mapped to definitions explaining each stage of digital transformation.

Each country is ranked on a scale of 1.00-5.99 for each sub-pillar and each data set within said sub-pillar.

# Digital Readiness Assessment
Insights from the Digital Development Compass combined with UNDP's Digital Readiness Assessment (DRA) product, a survey-based tool that provides rapid, high-level insights into a country's digital strengths and weaknesses. The DRA doesn't just provide ratings, but a cross-cutting, hybrid qualitative-quantitative analysis, delivering in a matter of weeks what previously took months, or even years.

# Our Methodology
## Inclusion of datasets
Based on: Reliability of source, relevance of the source, quality of methodology, and both recency and breadth of data.

## Data availability
Transparency into % of data unavailable per country per sub-pillar.

## Scoring
Stage of Digital Readiness is determined from score of 1-5.99. Indicators are converted from Index Data or Calculated according to min/max from Raw Data. Scores are Weighted and Averaged into Sub-Pillar Scores. Scores are Weighted and Averaged into Pillar Scores & paired with a % Data Availability Rate. Scores are Averaged into a Country's Overall Score and paired with a Reliability Score. Weightings of data and scores is under development.

## Peer Review
**This tool is in Beta**; we are currently under scientific peer review with Expert Advisors. This tool does not intend or imply any form of statistical significance.
